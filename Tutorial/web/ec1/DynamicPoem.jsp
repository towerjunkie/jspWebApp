           â€œYou just couldn't get hold of the things you had done and turn them 
           right again.<br>Such power might be given to the gods, but it was not
           given to men and women - that was probably a good thing.<br>Had it been
           otherwise, people would die of old age still trying to rewrite their teens."
           <br>-Stephen King
